# Product Requirements Document: AI-Native Cross-Platform UI Component Library

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 2025  
**Document Owner:** Product Team  
**Contributors:** Engineering, Design, Developer Relations  

## Executive Summary

We propose building an open-source, cross-platform UI component library that natively integrates AI capabilities into every component. This library will enable developers to create intelligent, adaptive, and contextually aware user interfaces with minimal configuration while maintaining full customization control.

## Problem Statement

Current UI component libraries are static and require extensive manual configuration for dynamic behavior. Developers face several challenges:

- **Static Components**: Traditional components lack contextual awareness and adaptability
- **Complex AI Integration**: Adding AI features to existing components requires significant custom development
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Building consistent experiences across web, mobile, and desktop requires multiple libraries
- **Developer Experience Gap**: No unified approach for building AI-powered interfaces
- **Accessibility Blindspots**: Manual accessibility implementation leads to inconsistent experiences

## Product Vision

Create the world's first truly AI-native UI component library - intelligent components for end users AND optimized for AI-assisted development. This library makes building intelligent, accessible, and adaptive interfaces as simple as using traditional components, while being designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and other agentic development tools.

- **Businesses** get comprehensive analytics and optimization without additional tools

### Sustainable Business Model

The open-source + SaaS hybrid approach creates multiple competitive advantages:
- **Community Growth**: Open source drives adoption and developer advocacy
- **Revenue Streams**: SaaS tiers provide sustainable funding for continued innovation
- **Network Effects**: Marketplace and ecosystem create strong competitive moats
- **Enterprise Value**: Compliance and security features command premium pricing

### Strategic Vision

By Year 3, this platform will be:
- The **standard for AI-native UI development** with 50K+ weekly downloads
