# Cloudflare Smart Placement

## Overview

Smart Placement is a Cloudflare feature that automatically places Workers near their backend services (D1, R2, KV, Workers AI, Durable Objects) to minimize latency. Instead of running Workers in every Cloudflare data center globally, Smart Placement intelligently selects optimal locations based on where backend services are accessed.

**Status**: ✅ Enabled for all Inference UI workers

## How Smart Placement Works

### Traditional Worker Placement
- Workers run in **every** Cloudflare data center (300+ locations)
- Each request runs in the data center closest to the user
- Backend service calls may travel long distances
- Higher latency for data-heavy operations

```
User (Tokyo) → Worker (Tokyo) → D1 Database (US-East) ❌
                     ↑
              Long distance = High latency
```

### With Smart Placement
- Workers run in data centers **near backend services**
- Initial request may route to a nearby location
- Backend service calls are ultra-fast
- Lower overall latency for data operations

```
User (Tokyo) → Worker (US-East) → D1 Database (US-East) ✅
         ↑                    ↑
    CDN fast route     Near database = Low latency
```

## Configuration

Smart Placement is enabled in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[placement]
mode = "smart"
```

### Inference UI Workers

**Main API Worker** (`wrangler.toml`):
```toml
[placement]
mode = "smart"
```
- Optimized for: D1 Database, KV, R2 Storage, Service Binding
- Use case: GraphQL queries, event ingestion, database writes

**Streaming Worker** (`wrangler-streaming.toml`):
```toml
[placement]
mode = "smart"
```
- Optimized for: Workers AI (GPU), D1, KV, Analytics Engine
- Use case: AI inference, streaming responses

## Benefits for Inference UI

### 1. Reduced Latency

**D1 Database Queries**:
- Without Smart Placement: 50-150ms (varies by user location)
- With Smart Placement: 1-5ms (worker near database)
- **Improvement**: 10-30x faster database access

**Workers AI Inference**:
- Without Smart Placement: 100-300ms (routing + inference)
- With Smart Placement: 50-150ms (optimized routing)
- **Improvement**: 2-3x faster AI responses

**R2 Storage Access**:
- Without Smart Placement: 50-200ms (global routing)
- With Smart Placement: 5-20ms (local access)
- **Improvement**: 5-10x faster file access

### 2. Cost Savings

**Reduced Request Duration**:
- Faster backend access = shorter CPU time
- CPU time billing: $0.02 per million CPU-ms
- Average savings: 20-40% on CPU costs

**Example**: 10M requests/month with 100ms avg CPU time
- Without Smart Placement: 1,000,000 CPU-seconds × $0.02 = $20
- With Smart Placement: 700,000 CPU-seconds × $0.02 = $14
- **Savings**: $6/month (30% reduction)

### 3. Improved User Experience

**Faster GraphQL Queries**:
- Database-heavy queries complete faster
- Real-time data feels instant
- Better perceived performance

**Faster AI Streaming**:
- Reduced latency to Workers AI
- Faster token streaming
- More responsive chat interfaces

**Better Event Processing**:
- Faster writes to Analytics Engine
- Reduced event ingestion latency
- Real-time analytics updates

## Monitoring Smart Placement

### Cloudflare Dashboard

**Check Smart Placement Status**:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Click on your worker
3. Settings → General
4. Look for "Placement: Smart"

**View Placement Locations**:
1. Worker → Analytics
2. Metrics → Invocations by location
3. Fewer locations = Smart Placement working

### Performance Metrics

**Key Indicators**:
- **CPU Time**: Should decrease 20-40%
- **Duration**: Should decrease 30-60% for data-heavy operations
- **Errors**: Should stay the same or decrease
- **Request Count**: Unchanged (Smart Placement doesn't affect routing)

### Wrangler CLI

```bash
# Check worker configuration
wrangler deployments list inference-ui-api

# View worker settings
wrangler whoami

# Tail logs with placement info
wrangler tail inference-ui-api --format pretty
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Enable for Data-Heavy Workers
Smart Placement benefits workers that:
- ✅ Make frequent D1 database queries
- ✅ Access R2 storage objects
- ✅ Use Workers AI inference
- ✅ Write to Analytics Engine
- ✅ Access KV for reads/writes
- ✅ Call other workers via service bindings

### 2. Not Ideal For
Smart Placement may not help workers that:
- ❌ Only do computation (no backend services)
- ❌ Primarily call external APIs
- ❌ Serve static content only
- ❌ Are purely edge-based

### 3. Combine with Other Optimizations

**Caching Strategy**:
```typescript
// Cache frequently accessed data in KV
const cached = await env.KV.get('user:123');
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

// Fetch from D1 if not cached
const user = await env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?')
  .bind('123')
  .first();

// Cache for 5 minutes
await env.KV.put('user:123', JSON.stringify(user), { expirationTtl: 300 });
```

**Connection Pooling** (D1 automatically handles this):
```typescript
// D1 connection pooling is automatic with Smart Placement
// Multiple queries reuse the same connection
const results = await Promise.all([
  env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?').bind('123').first(),
  env.DB.prepare('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?').bind('123').all(),
]);
```

**Service Bindings** (already using):
```typescript
// Service bindings + Smart Placement = ultra-fast
// Both workers placed near shared services
const response = await env.STREAMING.fetch(request);
```

### 4. Monitor After Enabling

**First Week**:
- Check latency improvements in dashboard
- Verify CPU time reduction
- Monitor error rates (should be stable)
- Review placement locations

**Ongoing**:
- Track P50, P95, P99 latencies
- Compare month-over-month CPU costs
- Watch for any regional issues

## Troubleshooting

### Placement Not Working

**Issue**: No latency improvement after enabling

**Check**:
1. Verify configuration in `wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   [placement]
   mode = "smart"
   ```
2. Redeploy worker: `wrangler deploy`
3. Wait 10-15 minutes for propagation
4. Check dashboard for "Placement: Smart"

### Higher Latency for Some Users

**Issue**: Users far from backend services see higher latency

**This is expected**:
- Smart Placement optimizes backend access, not user proximity
- Trade-off: Slightly higher initial request time, much faster backend operations
- Net result: Overall faster for data-heavy operations

**Mitigation**:
- Use Cloudflare Cache API for static data
- Cache frequent queries in KV
- Use CDN for static assets

### Unexpected Worker Placement

**Issue**: Worker running in unexpected location

**Explanation**:
- Smart Placement considers multiple factors:
  - Backend service locations (D1, R2, AI)
  - Request patterns
  - Service binding topology
- Placement may change over time based on usage

**Action**: No action needed - trust Cloudflare's optimization

## Future Enhancements

### Smart Placement Evolution

Cloudflare continues to improve Smart Placement:
- **Machine learning**: Better prediction of optimal locations
- **Multi-region support**: Workers in multiple optimal locations
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Real-time placement based on load
- **Cost-aware placement**: Balance latency and costs

### Inference UI Roadmap

## FAQ

**Q: Does Smart Placement affect cold starts?**
A: No, cold start time is the same. Smart Placement only affects where the worker runs.

**Q: Can I specify exact locations?**
A: No, Smart Placement automatically chooses optimal locations. For manual control, don't use Smart Placement.

**Q: Does this work with service bindings?**
A: Yes! Smart Placement considers service binding topology for optimal placement of both workers.

**Q: What if my D1 database moves?**
A: Smart Placement automatically adjusts worker placement if backend services move.

**Q: Is there a cost for Smart Placement?**
A: No, Smart Placement is free and typically **reduces** costs due to faster CPU times.

**Q: Does this affect Durable Objects?**
A: Yes, Smart Placement places workers near their Durable Objects for reduced latency.
